## Recap 

First we call the system prompt..

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fd08b00-af8e-4bdf-9b9d-9cd790f58512)

we have Thought and Action

we still have 2 tools which is the function that they can do.

After that we return the observation to loop back to the prompt.

Next, we will replace the formatted variable so we can have prompt templates.

## LangChain: Prompts use for prompt templates

New in LangGraph :

Most code will be loop Langraph we have this 3 new features.

* Cyclig Graphs - control flows
* Persistence bulit-in - Multiple agents and conversations remembering iterations and actions
* Human-in-the-loop

aimed at agent and multi-agent flows.
